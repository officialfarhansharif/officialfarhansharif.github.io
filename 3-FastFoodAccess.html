								<h4>Fast Food Access by Neighbourhood</h4>
								
								<div><a href="images/PORTFastFoodA.jpg" target="_blank" class="image left"><img src="images/PORTFastFoodA.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Fast food access in Toronto neighborhoods varies, with downtown and commercialized areas offering a high concentration of fast food options. 
									In contrast, residential and suburban neighborhoods may have fewer fast food establishments but a greater emphasis on local restaurants. This map 
									shows the neighbourhood incomes within Toronto and highlights the neighbhourhoods with highest fast food restaurant densities within the city. In 
									addition, the high density neighbhourhoods with lowest quartile of median income are also highlighted to give a perspective on the types of socioeconomic 
									classes that exhibit such high fast food resaurants densities.

								<h4>Fast Food Access from High Schools</h4>
								<div><a href="images/PORTFastFoodB.jpg" target="_blank" class="image right"><img src="images/PORTFastFoodB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Fast food accessibility from high schools in Toronto varies across neighborhoods. While some high schools may 
									have a variety of fast food options within walking distance or a short bus ride, others may have limited choices or 
									promote healthier eating habits. Availability and proximity to fast food establishments depend on the specific location of 
									the high school within the city. This map, in addition to neighbourhood income, illustrates the neighbourhoods and schools with relatively easy access to fast food restaurants
									with the closest three restaurants for each schools being less than 500 m walking distance away.
